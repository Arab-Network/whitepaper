## **Introducing The Arab Blockchain**

**Arab Network Blockchain** combines the best of Ethereum and sovereign blockchains to give a full-stack scaling solution for public blockchains. &#x20;

The Arab Network Development team has already developed a user-friendly mobile app wallet and browser extension. Users will be able to pay, transfer, and hold crypto assets without concern for the underlying system's complexity.

## **Arab Blockchain Protocol**

### **How** Arab Network Blockchain is Such a Unique Blockchain? <a href="#why-is-algorand-such-a-unique-blockchain" id="why-is-algorand-such-a-unique-blockchain"></a>

**Arab Network Blockchain** has solved the blockchain trilemma challenge for crypto developers & creators: decentralization, scale, and security. You may now innovate on a solid foundation.

## **Noorseen Protocol**

**Arab Network Blockchain** uses Polygon Edge as a modular and extensible framework to build a sidechain Ethereum scaling solution by using the consensus algorithms supported on Polygon Edge to our Permissionless mechanism called "**Noorseen Protocol"** that uses (PoA) & (PoS) consensus mechanism. With blocks finalized in seconds, Arab Network Blockchain is enabling ultimate security, fast transaction finality, and low transaction fees on Ethereum.

## Decentralization

**Arab Network Blockchain** technology is completely decentralized, which means that there is no central authority or single point of control. Each block is approved by a special committee of users chosen randomly and in secrecy. Nodes are operated by entities from a variety of different countries.

## Fair, Transparent  & Secure <a href="#secure" id="secure"></a>

Any validator misbehavior is met with instant repercussions on the amount staked

Validators stake Arabcoin on the mainnet before validating the network

Validators verify all the transactions on Arab Network&#x20;

## Permissionless <a href="#permissionless" id="permissionless"></a>

#### Public & Open to All <a href="#public-open-to-all" id="public-open-to-all"></a>

**Arab Network Blockchain** users do not require the approval of a trusted authority. Each participant has the ability to read every block and write a transaction in a future block.

#### Low Cost to Participate <a href="#low-cost-to-participate" id="low-cost-to-participate"></a>

To join the **Arab Network** platform, you only need a little amount of computing power and a small amount of IT resources.

## **Consensus Mechanism**

### Proof of Authority (PoA)

**Arab Network Blockchain** is based on the Polygone Edge architecture and utilizes a decentralized Byzantine agreement protocol that uses The IBFT PoA consensus mechanism.&#x20;

validators are the ones responsible for creating the blocks and adding them to the blockchain in a series.

All of the validators make up a dynamic validator-set, where validators can be added to or removed from the set by employing a voting mechanism. This means that validators can be voted in/out from the validators-set if the majority (51%) of the validator nodes vote to add/drop a certain validator to/from the set. In this way, malicious validators can be recognized and removed from the network, while new trusted validators can be added to the network.

All of the validators take turns in proposing the next block (round-robin), and for the block to be validated/inserted in the blockchain, a supermajority (more than 2/3) of the validators must approve the said block.

Besides validators, there are non-validators who do not participate in the block creation but do participate in the block validation process

Users have a proportional influence on selecting a new block in proportion to their stake in the system (number of ArabCoins).&#x20;

## **ChainBridge**

**Arab Network blockchain** also allows connection with different blockchain networks, providing transfers of both [ERC-20](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20), [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721)**,** and other chains through a bridge solution.

ChainBridge is a modular bidirectional blockchain bridge that is compatible with EVM and Substrate chains. It enables users to send any type of asset or message to another chain.
