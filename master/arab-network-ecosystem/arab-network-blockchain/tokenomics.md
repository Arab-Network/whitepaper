# Tokenomics

Tokenomics are important&#x20;

Briefly, supply and demand are the names of the game with tokenomics. As with all assets, the smaller the supply and the bigger the demand, the higher the value.

Therefore, it is essential to understand the total supply of each cryptocurrency and how much of this supply circulates.
