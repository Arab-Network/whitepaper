# Community Governance

## How does it work?

In Arab Gate wallet the governance that we want to build came naturally. We always have lots of projects approaching us, and we don't want to make the decision ourselves and be the one that says: "This blockchain is good and this one is not." It needs to be done by the community, where they vote on the blockchains they think are valuable to them, so we don't have any bias, like, "Oh, this blockchain is backed by good investors, so we're going to add it". We delegate it to the community.

For any blockchain to be integrated into Arab Gate Wallet, they're required to prepare a proposal, and then users who hold (Arabcoin Token) are able to vote on it. There's a threshold to be met, and then that blockchain can be integrated.

This will also apply to any feature we want to add to the wallet. After we propose the feature, ArabCoin token holders need to vote and approve the feature to be deployed.
