# Introduction

## **Problem**

Blockchain technology is best known as the technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, but its applications are far wider. Some Arab nations are taking steps toward embracing it in providing government and commercial services and managing supply chain systems. But efforts to teach this technology in the Arab world are considered too slow compared to the western world, and that's due to the absence of a dedicated ecosystem for the Arab community.

## **Solution**&#x20;

Arab Network is building a revolutionary ecosystem for the Arab community, A one-stop complete Ecosystem of Open Infrastructure Financial and Educational Services that focuses on security and user-friendliness to get blockchain technology closer to massive adoption.

### **What is Arab Network?**

Arab Network is a community that doesn't have a central command. There is no single owner. Instead, a group of people shares their knowledge in blockchain technology, business, and education, working together to empower the Arab community for a better future.

Arab Network is founding an innovative community that will raise awareness on technology around the Arab World.

### **Our Vision**

A world where value is created and exchanged by everyone in an efficient, open, and secure manner.
